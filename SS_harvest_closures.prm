# Heidi Pethybridge - Javier Porobic
# Developed May 2019, using Javiers R scripts to create base Harvest.prm file
# Salish Sea model consists of 130 boxes (2 boundary, 44 islands); 7 vertical layers
# 58 functional groups: 33 Vertebrates (21 fish, 4 shark, 2 bird, 6 mammal);
# 			22 inverts (2 fish-invert, cep, prawn, spong, seagrass, macroalgae, 6 plankton, 3 infauna, 4 epibenthos, bacteria, detritus)

## History of activities:
## parameters DONE: flagfish, flagF, mFC_XXX , _mFC_startage (2 for all), habitat_XX (all), fisheryXX_maxdepth/mindepth,
## current mFC parameters are estimates.
## it will be based mostly on stock assessments (using model F estimates or catch data) # parameters need changing:   q_AQT, sel_, FFCDR_, Effort_hdistrib, Effort_vdistrib, ports_

# Number of fisheries = 18 (2 IsRec ; 2 IsAquaculture)
